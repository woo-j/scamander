 Included here is the Silent Night program from "Singing SC/MP" as well 
 as other programs which produce other tunes... This is an attempt to 
 re-create the programs on the ESS-2 record which is now extremely rare, so 
 each program will play one tune from the track listing of that record,
 although the exact implementation may not be the same as the original.
